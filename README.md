### Database OverView
We used 4 different Mongo Collections
The 'players' collection is accessed by the Players variable
The 'games' collection is accessed by the Games variable
The 'images' collection is accessed by the Images variable

Meteor provides a 'users' collection that comes with the accounts-ui package. It is accessed through calls to Meteor.user() and Meteor.userId()

We didn't use mongoose to define schemas for the project (I don't even know if it's possible), but in documenting the database we're going to imitate mongoose's layout for clairty:

var playerSchema = new Schema({
  _id:  String, /*assigned in code based off of the Meteor.userId(), for continuity*/
  gameList: [String, String, ...] /*mongoIds for games player is currently playing*/
});

var gameSchema = new Schema({
  _id:  String, /*dynamically created by mongo*/
  gameName:  String, /*non-unique game*/
  createdBy: String, /*Meteor.userId() of game creator */
  participants: [String, String, String,...], /*userIds. players participating in game*/
  featList:  [{name:String}, {name:String}, {name:String},... ] /*array of featName objects (this could be an array of featnames, without objects, but this design was left over from when featList contained more details)*/
});

var imagesSchema = new Schema({
  _id: String, /*dynamically created by mongo*/
  userId: String, /*Meteor.userId() of image creator*/
  username: String, /*Meteor.user().username*/
  gameId: String, /*mongoIds for game image is associated with*/
  featName: String, /*name associated with each feat from featList*/
  photoURL: ImageData, /*image data*/
  voteCount: Integer, /*increment or decrements as people vote on the photo*/
  downVotes: [String, String, String, ...], /*userIds. In order to keep people from downvoting twice, we maintained a list of people who had down voted the image*/
  upVotes: [String, String, String, ...], /*userIds. In order to keep people from upvoting twice, we maintained a list of people who had up voted the image*/
});
